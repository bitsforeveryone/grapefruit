Grapefuzz
=========

These wrappers are examples of how to fuzz a large number of binaries in a directory using existing tools. For simple custom fuzzers, such as Python print statements or shell scrips. Easy crash detection can be accomplished by monitoring dmesg or enabling core dumps. Timeout should be adjusted depending on the fuzzer being used. 

Brute Force Binary Tester is another tool which allows fuzzing a large number of binaries with little effort.
